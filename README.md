# eosal
Operating system abstraction layer. 15.4.2020 status: Works with iocom library for ESP32 and Linux, Windows stuff lags behind, and other microcontrollers are just prototype level and have not been updated lately. 
- Eosal still lacks much documentation
- Some features, like microcontroller flash programming support is not done. 
- ESP32 Ethernet (on LWIP) and TLS implementation (on MbedTSL) are quite crude, etc.
