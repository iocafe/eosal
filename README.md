# eosal
Operating system abstraction layer. 7.8.2020 status: Works with iocom library for ESP32 and Linux, Windows stuff lags behind, and other microcontrollers are just prototype level and have not been updated lately. 
- The eosal library still lacks much documentation
- Some features are not done. 
- ESP32 Ethernet (on LWIP) and TLS implementation (on MbedTLS) are quite crude, etc.
