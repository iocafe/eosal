mbedtls can not verify certificate - note 29.1.2020/pekka

The solution that worked for me to switch to mbedtls:

+ change to RSA 2048
+ change certificate digest from MD5 to SHA256 (use option "default_md = sha256").

The default digest used by easy-rsa key generation scripts was "md5", and it was rejected by mbedtls.
